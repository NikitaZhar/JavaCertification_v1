Which of the following are not valid variable names? (Choose two.)#A. _%%B. _blue%%C. 2blue%%D. blue$%%E. Blue#A%%C#An identifier name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or underscore (_). Numbers are permitted only for subsequent characters. Therefore, option C is not a valid variable name. Additionally, an identifier may not be a single underscore, making option A an invalid variable name.
What is the value of tip after executing the following code snippet?
int meal = 5;
int tip = 2;
var total = meal + (meal>6 ? tip++ : tip--);#A. 1%%B. 2%%C. 3%%D. 7%%E. None of the above#A#In a ternary expression, only one of the two right-most expressions is evaluated. Since meal>6 is false, tip-- is evaluated, and tip++ is skipped. The result is that tip is changed from 2 to 1, making option A the correct answer. The value of total is 7, since the post-decrement operator was used on tip, although you did not need to know this to solve the question.
Which is equivalent to var q = 4.0f;?#A. float q = 4.0f;%%B. Float q = 4.0f;%%C. double q = 4.0f;%%D. Double q = 4.0f; E. Object q = 4.0f;#A#The f in 4.0f means the type is a float, making option A correct. Local variable type inference chooses an exact match rather than using autoboxing to choose Float.
